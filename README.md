# CSS Merry-go-round

This repository showcases a CSS solution for a "merry-go-round" style sliding showcase.

A set of items are given a value (position in space or time) and then there is a main value relative to which
are of them are positioned.

The center of the control is in its visual middle, so a main value of zero with an item with a value of zero
will result in an item being placed dead center of the container control with the middle axis going through it.
